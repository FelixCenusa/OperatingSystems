## Lab 1: Processes, Threads, and Memory Systems

This lab focuses on understanding processes and threads, their communication, synchronization, and the impact of memory systems on performance.

### Part 1: Task Solutions
- **Task 7**: Introduced `squaredId` in `threadArgs`, squared each thread's ID, and used `pthread_join` to wait for all threads to complete and print the squared IDs.
- **Task 9**: Created multiple threads to perform transactions using semaphores to ensure data integrity and atomicity.
- **Task 11**: Implemented a solution to avoid deadlocks in the dining philosophers problem by ensuring both forks/chopsticks are picked up simultaneously.
- **Task 13**: Achieved a 75% speedup in matrix multiplication through parallelization.
- **Task 14**: Achieved a 70% speedup in matrix initialization and calculation through parallelization.

### Part 2: Task Solutions
- **Task 17**: Implemented the FIFO page replacement algorithm and verified its correctness against known results.
